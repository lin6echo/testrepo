# Python Indentation

# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

# Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 

# You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

# Python Variables

# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

# Variables in Python:

x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Comments

# Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

# Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

# Comments in Python:

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
