# Python Indentation

# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

# Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

 print("Five is greater than two!")
