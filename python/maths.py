# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
# You can do mathematical calculations with python as long as you know the right operators.
3 + 2 # Add
4 - 1 # Subtract
2 * 3 # Multiply
5 / 2 # Divide
5 ** 2 # Exponent

# THE += OPERATOR
# This is a convenient way to modify a variable.
# It takes the existing value in a variable and adds to it.
# You can also use any of the other mathematical operators e.g. -= or *=
my_number = 4
my_number += 2
print(my_number) # result is 6 

# THE MODULO OPERATOR
# Often you'll want to know what is the remainder after a division.
# e.g. 4 รท 2 = 2 with no remainder
# but 5 รท 2 = 2 with 1 remainder
# The modulo does not give you the result of the division, just the remainder.
# It can be really helpful in certain situations, e.g. figuring out if a number is odd or even.
5 % 2
# result is 1
